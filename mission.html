          At the heart of Mentally.me is a simple idea. KIND WORDS. We live in a
          very interconnected world and yet at the same time for a lot of people
          that means feeling even more isolated. But what if at its core a
          platform existed that aimed to put people and human connection first.
          What if the idea of helping someone undergoing difficulties,
          struggling through hard times, or needing someone to talk to was built
          into the core of a platform? We all go through ups and downs, and we
          all should have someone who is in our corner, to share those
          experiences with. We should feel like we can be our authentic self, in
          a world that asks us to curate so much of our lives all the time.
          Sometimes a kind word from a stranger can be the deciding factor that
          turns another person's day around.
          <br />
          <br />
          One of the primary goals of Mentally.me is to offer a simpler platform
          where people can share how they feel, (the good and the bad) and to
          allow others to be there for others. We feel it is time we try and
          change the sort of conversations we have with ourselves and with each
          other online. To offer a place where people can find a connection,
          community, and compassion. Sometimes all it takes to better someone's
          day is a kind word. So, let's brave the storm together.
